<b><i>We can see there is no a huge change b/w age and fare.

<b><i>=> By seeing the graph, We can conclude that Females survived from all 3 Embarked and males died more from vSouthampton and we can predict that most died Males may be belonged to Pclass 3 as its survival rate is less.</i></b>

<b><i> 1)=> By seeing the graph, We can conclude that for Cherboung has almost same distribution of Pclass among both Sex categories.

2)=> In Queenstown almost all people in both Sex categories boarded ther ticket in PClass 3.

3)=> In vSouthampton males have slight edge for buying Pclass 1 ticket over females. And more males have buyed Pclass 3 ticket. Our prediction was right in the last question. </i></b>

```
<br>


<b><i>1)=> By seeing the graph, We can see the different age range for buying different Pclass tickets. The thicker areas somewhere means people of same age are more who brought that Ticket.

2)=> We can also see for vSouthampton, for Pclass 1 age category is fully covered from 1 to 80 i.e from a small child to an oldage all types of people are there.

3)=> We can also see for vSouthampton, for Pclass 3 age category the area is very thicker between age 17 to 50 that concludes this range people have buyed more PClass 3 tickets. </i></b>

<br>


<b><i>1)=> By seeing the plot, the line shows the fare range as per differnt Embarked.

2)=> For Cherboung the variation of Fare is pretty high. Distribution of Fare are more between (0,100) so that must be Pclass 3 ticket. There are some more distribution above 100 upto 500 that shows Pclass 2 ticket will be aroung (100,250) and furture is Pclass 3

3)#=> For Queenstown the distribution of Fare are mostly between (0,100).We can conclude people boarded from there are less and brought PClass 3 tickets more compared to other tickets**

4)#=> For vSouthapton we see too much overplotting between (0,100) so that must be Pclass 3 ticket. There are some more distribution above 100 upto 260 approx.

5)#=>It gives an important conclution that PClass ticket prices vary for differnt Embarked as we have seen Pclass 1 ticket for vSouthampton but max price is only 260 here. And there may be discrimination of Fare based on Gender. </i></b>
